# How to Create Premium Product Animation from a Single Image

Complete guide for creating professional product animations using Google Labs AI tools.

## What You Get

- **Two premium images** - Start and end frame
- **One smooth video transition**
- **Web-optimized output** ready for hero section or web shop

## Who Needs This

- If you sell physical products
- If you want better visuals without a photo studio or video shooting
- If you want content that looks more expensive than the actual production cost

## Tools We'll Use

| Tool | Purpose | Link |
|------|---------|------|
| **WHISK** | Premium image generation | [labs.google/fx/tools/whisk](https://labs.google/fx/tools/whisk) |
| **FLOW** | Video transitions | [labs.google/flow/about](https://labs.google/flow/about) |
| **EZGIF** | WebP conversion | [ezgif.com/video-to-webp](https://ezgif.com/video-to-webp) |

> **Important:** WHISK and FLOW are paid services. These are NOT free tools. You have limits through credits and tokens.

## Step 1: Prepare a Good Product Image

Use an image that is:
- Sharp
- Well-lit
- Without too many reflections
- Framed to show the entire product

> **Warning:** If you start with a bad image, everything after will look bad. AI won't save a poor foundation.

---

## Step 2: WHISK - Stabilize Your Product (Start Frame)

Here you do one thing: get a "clean" premium product photo that you can use as the start frame.

### How to do it:
1. Open WHISK
2. Register if needed
3. Enter the tool
4. In **Subject** upload your product image
5. In the **prompt field** enter the prompt below

### Prompt for Start Frame

```
Create a high-quality product image using the uploaded photo of the scented candle flower arrangement.

Place the candle arrangement centered in the frame with a natural, gentle tilt similar to luxury home decor photography.

Use soft, clean studio lighting with subtle highlights and shadows to emphasize wax textures and floral shapes. Light should feel warm and inviting.

Keep all candle forms, colors, and details sharp.

STYLE:
• Premium handmade candle look
• Soft, elegant, calm mood
• Simple aesthetic like modern home fragrance ads

BACKGROUND:
• Pastel warm cream or soft beige
• No harsh contrasts
• No distracting textures
• Light shadow under product only to add depth

FRAMING:
• Full vertical frame
• Product centered
• Enough margin for later motion editing

OUTPUT:
• High-resolution still image
• Background easy to mask/match brand palette
• Preserve original wax color and proportions
```

### Critically Important
- **Don't ask for creativity. Ask for control.**
- Don't change the product. Just "polish" it
- Keep the same angle, proportions, and colors

If your first image turns out bad, the problem isn't the "tool". The problem is the prompt or the input image.

---

## Step 3: WHISK - Generate the Final Frame (End Frame)

Here you create the end frame. This is the image where fragrance elements appear around the product.

**Important:**
- Now you use the start image you generated as the new Subject
- Don't go back to the original, because you want a consistent style

### Prompt for End Frame

```
Using the uploaded product image, generate the final frame of a product animation for a handmade scented candle flower arrangement.

The candle arrangement floats in the center of the frame with a gentle forward tilt. Angle feels soft and elegant. Focus stays on craftsmanship and floral details.

INGREDIENT BURST:
• Surround the candle with floating scent elements inspired by the fragrance (dried flowers, rose petals, lavender, vanilla pods, citrus peel)
• Elements spread outward in a calm, organic motion. No aggressive explosion
• Include a soft wax-like swirl or delicate fragrance mist wrapping partially around the arrangement
• Ingredients appear suspended in air, crisp and sharp, like high-speed studio photography
• Candle shapes and floral forms stay fully visible and unobstructed

STYLE:
• Soft commercial studio lighting
• Warm highlights on wax petals
• Clear texture on flowers and box
• Calm, elegant composition inspired by premium home decor and gift visuals
• Feminine, gentle, refined mood

PRODUCT POSITION:
• Center of the frame
• Slight forward tilt for hero look
• Ingredients placed around the product with balanced spacing for animation

BACKGROUND:
• Warm pastel background matching brand aesthetic
• Soft cream, blush beige, or warm off-white
• Flat background or subtle fabric-like softness
• No harsh contrast
• Clean and consistent for hero section use

OUTPUT:
• High-resolution final frame
• Product centered with floating fragrance elements
• Background suitable for webshop hero section
• Exact colors, shapes, and proportions preserved
• Photorealistic, premium handmade candle look
```

### Common Mistakes Here
- Elements cover the product
- Elements look like an explosion
- Background changes tone so the video later "breaks" visually

If this happens, shorten the "ingredient burst" section and emphasize **"unobstructed, calm, balanced spacing"**.

## Step 4: FLOW - Create the Transition from Start to End

Flow does one thing: **converts two images into a video**.

### How to do it:
1. Open FLOW
2. Create a New Project
3. Select **Frames to Video**
4. In the left frame upload the start image
5. In the right frame upload the end image
6. Enter the transition prompt

### Prompt for Video Transition

```
Create a smooth animated transition using the uploaded product image of a handmade scented candle flower arrangement.

SCENE START:
Begin with the candle arrangement gently floating and slightly tilted to the left. Movement feels slow, elegant, and calming. Product appears centered on a warm, soft pastel background.

BACKGROUND:
• Warm cream, blush beige, or soft pastel gradient
• Light, airy, and calm tone
• No harsh contrast
• No dark colors
• Suitable for hero section on a webshop

TRANSITION MOTION:
As the candle slowly rotates toward the viewer, introduce fragrance elements gradually from behind and around the product.

INGREDIENT INTRO:
• Floating rose petals
• Lavender sprigs
• Vanilla pods
• Citrus peel curls
• Small natural fragrance particles

Elements enter softly and organically, as if carried by warm air. Motion stays gentle and refined.

FRAGRANCE SWIRL:
Add a soft, luminous wax or fragrance swirl wrapping partially around the arrangement. Motion looks silky and light, not explosive. Glow stays subtle and warm.

BUILD-UP:
Increase the number of floating fragrance elements gradually. Composition becomes richer but remains elegant and balanced. Nothing feels chaotic.

PRODUCT FOCUS:
• Candle arrangement always fully visible
• No elements covering flower candles
• Wax texture and floral details stay sharp
• Box edges clean and defined

LIGHTING:
• Soft studio lighting
• Warm highlights on wax petals
• Gentle shadows for depth
• Calm, premium mood

FINAL FRAME:
End on a fully formed fragrance composition similar to the ingredient-burst image. Candle centered, surrounded by floating scent elements and soft swirl.

OUTPUT:
• High-resolution animation frames
• Hero-ready composition for webshop
• Colors aligned with brand palette
• Exact product shape, color, and proportions preserved
• Feminine, warm, premium handmade candle aesthetic
```

> **Critically Important:** If the start and end images aren't consistent, Flow creates a weird "morph". That looks cheap. That's why you first polish the images in Whisk.

## Step 5: EZGIF - Convert Video to WebP and Frames

Do this when you want a web-friendly animation. WebP is lighter and faster to load than classic video.

### How to do it:
1. Open [EZGIF video to WebP](https://ezgif.com/video-to-webp)
2. Upload the video
3. Set Start time to **0s**
4. Set End time to **end of video**
5. Set Method to **FFMPEG**
6. Click **Convert to WebP**
7. Download the zip

### What You Get
- WebP file
- Zip with frames

Then upload it to the web, or give it to a developer to implement.

## Warning About Pricing and Limits

Google Labs tools have a payment and credit system. You have limits through tokens and credits.

More information: [support.google.com/googleone/answer/16287445](https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/16287445)

---

## When I DON'T Recommend This

- **If the product must look 100% identical to the real photo** - AI can "lie" about details
- **If you don't have time for iterations** - Sometimes it takes multiple attempts
- **If you need consistency for 50 products** - Then you need a system and templates, not manual work

---

## Conclusion

This text gives you the process and prompts to get started.

**Start with one product.** Don't do a series until you get one result that looks premium.
